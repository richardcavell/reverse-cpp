reverse-cpp
Version 1.3

lhmouse & Richard Cavell
(c) 2017-2025

reverse-cpp is a program to read the standard input and print its reverse
to the standard output. It is written in the C++17 dialect of standard C++.
It uses no libraries outside of standard C++.

The current version was written by lhmouse. (https://github.com/lhmouse) It
has been benchmarked and seems to be the optimal approach.

The primary purpose of this project is to allow a comparison with the
reverse-c project. That is all. You may use this code, but please don't.
You should use it to learn the programming techniques and then apply them
on your own.

If your compiler cannot compile the main program, try compiling alternate.cpp,
which is also written primarily by lhmouse.
