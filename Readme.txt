reverse-cpp is a program to read the standard input and print its reverse
to the standard output. It is written in the C++14 dialect of standard C++.
It uses no libraries outside of standard C++.

The primary purpose of this project is to allow a comparison with the
reverse-c project. That is all. Please do not use this code. You should use
it to learn the programming technique and then apply it on your own.
